                        <p>The purpose of the first lab is to get familiar with the Artemis nano board and the Arduino IDE. Example codes from IDE are used to verify the Artemis board works properly.

                        <p>At the end of this lab, several functions including blink the LED, read/write serial messages over USB, display the output from the onboard temperature sensor, 
                           and measure the loudest frequency recorded by the Pulse Density Microphone were achieved using example codes. The board was programmed to blink LED when musical "A" note (frequency 440 Hz) is detected.

That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
